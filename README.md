# 🌞 **Data visualization of Montreal's Total Solar Eclipse** 🌑

## 🔍 Reason

On the day of the eclipse, our class was given the challenge of tracking the **temperature**, **humidity**, and **luminosity** during the solar eclipse.

With the data I acquired, I decided to make a Google Colab to use my knowledge of Python & data science gained from my [AI project](https://github.com/carsonSgit/TradeMind) for [AI Launch Lab's R&D Program](https://launchlab.ai/) and from my [hackathon submission](https://github.com/GodPuffin/Pharmahacks2024) for [PharmaHacks 2024](https://pharmahacks.com/). 

## 🔬 End Result

If you're curious about the end result of my analysis, go see my Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CQRKA0F4S26oeLIa3MzIPkeho72_VQC1?usp=sharing) or directly from this GitHub repo.
